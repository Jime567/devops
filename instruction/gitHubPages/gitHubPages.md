# GitHub Pages

https://create-react-app.dev/docs/deployment/#github-pages

```sh
npm -D install gh-pages
```

Modify package.json

```json
  "scripts": {
    "predeploy": "npm run build",
    "deploy": "gh-pages -d dist"
  },
  "homepage": "https://github.com/byucsstudent/jwt-pizza.git",
```

git remote set-url origin https://byucsstudent:xxxx@github.com/byucsstudent/jwt-pizza.git

I had to change all the paths to be relative and add a vite config so that it doesn't put an absolute base path.
