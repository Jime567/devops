For the purposes of this course, we could pick any of the top UI testing frameworks. However, we are going to pick a newcomer, Playwright. Playwright has some major advantages. It is backed by Microsoft, it integrates really well with VS Code, and it runs as a Node.js process. It is also considered one of the least flaky of the testing frameworks.

Playwright gets its speed and stability by running directly against each of the major browsers DevTool API. This is a major advantage over other tools that either directly or indirectly use the Selenium WebDriver or only support a single browser.

## Tutorial project

In order to have something that we can use to demonstrate how to use Playwright, we need to first create an example project. Take the following steps:

1. Create a test directory
   ```sh
   mkdir playwrightExample && cd playwrightExample
   ```
1. Create the basic Vite React app.
   ```sh
   npm init -y
   npm install vite@latest -D
   npm install react react-dom
   ```
1. Modify `package.json`
   ```json
     "scripts": {
       "dev": "vite"
     },
   ```
1. Create a very simple `index.html` home page
   ```html
   <!DOCTYPE html>
   <html lang="en">
     <head>
       <title>Playwright example</title>
     </head>
     <body>
       <div id="root"></div>
       <script type="module" src="/index.jsx"></script>
     </body>
   </html>
   ```
1. Create a simple `index.jsx` React application

   ```jsx
   import React from 'react';
   import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client';

   ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root')).render(<App />);

   function App() {
     const [count, setCount] = React.useState(1);
     const [menu, setMenu] = React.useState([]);

     async function getMenu() {
       const response = await fetch('https://jwt-pizza-service.cs329.click/api/order/menu');
       const data = await response.json();
       setMenu(
         data.map((item, i) => (
           <li key={i}>
             {item.title}-{item.description}
           </li>
         ))
       );
     }

     return (
       <div>
         <h1>Pizza</h1>
         <p>{'üçï'.repeat(count)}</p>
         <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>+1</button>
         <button disabled={!!menu.length} onClick={getMenu}>
           Menu
         </button>
         <ul>{menu}</ul>
       </div>
     );
   }
   ```

   Now you can run `npm run dev` and experiment with the demonstration application. Notice that you can order pizzas by pressing the `+1` button and get the JWT pizza menu by pressing `Menu`. Once the menu is displayed it will disable the menu option. Get familiar with the code so that you are ready to start writing your UI tests.

## Installing Playwright

With our demonstration app created we are ready to install Playwright. While installing tell it to use JavaScript, use the `tests` directory, ignore the GitHub Actions workflow for now, and not install any Playwright browsers.

```sh
npm init playwright@latest
```

This will update `package.json` with the `playwright` package, create a `playwright.config.js` file, and create some sample tests in the `test` and `tests-examples` directories. This will also update your `.gitignore` file so that you don't accidentally check in test coverage or report information.

### Install a testing browser

If you review the `playwright.config.js` file you will notice the configuration of the browser it will run.

```js
  /* Configure projects for major browsers */
  projects: [
    {
      name: 'chromium',
      use: { ...devices['Desktop Chrome'] },
    },

    {
      name: 'firefox',
      use: { ...devices['Desktop Firefox'] },
    },

    {
      name: 'webkit',
      use: { ...devices['Desktop Safari'] },
    },
```

For simplicity sake, we will only tests with `chromium` and so delete the other entries. Once you have modified the file we need to go install the `chromium` driver.

```sh
npx playwright install --with-deps chromium
```

## Running your first test

The easiest way to run your first Playwright tests is to use the examples that came with the Playwright installation.

```sh
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ tests
‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ example.spec.js
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ tests-examples
 ¬†¬† ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ demo-todo-app.spec.js
```

Playwright will run any test found in its testing directory as defined by the `testDir` property in the `playwright.config.js` file. By default this is set to the `tests` directory. The `example.spec.js` found in the `tests` directory contains two simple tests. The first test goes to the Playwright website and checks to make sure the resulting page has the title `Playwright`.

```js
test('has title', async ({ page }) => {
  await page.goto('https://playwright.dev/');
  await expect(page).toHaveTitle(/Playwright/);
});
```

You can run the tests from your project directory with the following console command.

```sh
npx playwright test

Running 2 tests using 2 workers
  2 passed (1.1s)
```

Congratulations you have just ran your first Playwright test.

### Viewing the results

In addition to outputting the result to the console, this will create a file named `test-results/.last-run.json` that contains the result of running the test.

If you want to see a visual report in a browser window you can run:

```
npx playwright show-report
```

This will allow you to interactively review what happened with the test.

![test result in browser](testResultInBrowser.png)

### Interactive execution

You can also run the test using the Playwright UI mode.

```sh
npx playwright test -ui
```

This opens up a window that shows all the tests found in the `tests` directory and allows you to interactively execute them and review the results. This includes a time lapse overview of what the browser was doing while it executed and the ability to see the state of the browser during each step of the test.

## Configuring to run with Vite

Before we can write our own tests we need to finish configuring Playwright. Open the `playwright.config.js` file and modify it so that it will launch our service when ever a test needs to run. This is done by adding a `webServer` section to the config that provides the startup command for Vite and the URL that our service is running from.

```js
  webServer: {
    command: 'npm run dev',
    url: 'http://localhost:5173',
    reuseExistingServer: !process.env.CI,
    timeout: 5000,
  },
```

You can also remove all the comments in order to make the file easier to read. When you are done your configuration file should look like the following.

```js
const { defineConfig, devices } = require('@playwright/test');

module.exports = defineConfig({
  testDir: './tests',
  fullyParallel: true,
  forbidOnly: !!process.env.CI,
  retries: process.env.CI ? 2 : 0,
  workers: process.env.CI ? 1 : undefined,
  reporter: 'html',

  /* Configure projects for major browsers */
  projects: [
    {
      name: 'chromium',
      use: { ...devices['Desktop Chrome'] },
    },
  ],

  /* Run your local dev server before starting the tests */
  webServer: {
    command: 'npm run dev',
    url: 'http://localhost:5173',
    reuseExistingServer: !process.env.CI,
    timeout: 5000,
  },
});
```

## VS Code Playwright extension

[Playwright extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-playwright.playwright)

The VS Code extension for Playwright is well worth the time to install and master. You can actually use it to install Playwright for your project instead of using the manual steps defined above.

Just like the Jest VS Code extension, the Playwright extension will detect that you have Playwright tests and allow you to run them from the `flask` menu of the sidebar.

Some of the cool features include:

- Installing other browsers
- In context error messages
- Debugging tests
- Picking a locator by clicking on an element
- Recording a new tests
- Record starting at the cursor
- Displaying the trace viewer

You can also debug your tests by placing a break point and walking through

## Writing your own tests

Now you are ready to write your first test against our demonstration service.

Let's start by getting rid of the example tests. To do this you can either delete the `example.spec.js` file or move it to the `tests-examples` directory.

### Recording a test

We can create our test by using the VS Code Playwright extensions ability to recording the interactions with the browser. To start the recording press the `Record new` new option found under the `Playwright panel` of the Test Explorer side pane.

> ![Playwright record test](playwrightRecordTest.gif)

When you start the recording it will open up a browser window and connect to the server that you specified in the Playwright configuration file.

You can then navigate to the desired webpage, interact with the page components and add assertions from the recording toolbar.

When you are done, press the stop button and view the resulting test case.

### Examining the test

The test we recorded demonstrates all the interactions we recorded.

```js
test('test', async ({ page }) => {
  await page.goto('http://localhost:5173/');
  await page.getByRole('button', { name: '+' }).click();
  await page.getByRole('button', { name: '+' }).click();
  await expect(page.getByText('üçïüçïüçï')).toBeVisible();
  await page.getByRole('button', { name: 'Menu' }).click();
  await expect(page.getByRole('list')).toContainText('Veggie-A garden of delight');
});
```

You can see how Playwright tries to abstract away as much of the locating of page elements as possible. Instead of using a CSS selector to find an element, it tries to find things by roles that have some distinguishing characteristic. For example, the different buttons are located by finding a role of button with with a `+` or `Menu` in their text.

```sh
  await page.getByRole('button', { name: '+' }).click();
```

Using the `expect` function we can assert that the desired changes happened in reaction to our clicks. Either that something was visible or that it contained certain text.

```sh
  await expect(page.getByText('üçïüçïüçï')).toBeVisible();
  await expect(page.getByRole('list')).toContainText('Veggie-A garden of delight');
```

### Modifying the test

Let's change the test up a bit to add some validation.

```js
test('test', async ({ page }) => {
  await page.goto('http://localhost:5173/');
  await expect(page.getByText('Pizza')).toBeVisible();
  await expect(page.getByText('üçï')).toBeVisible();

  const expected = 'üçïüçïüçïüçïüçï';
  await page.getByRole('button', { name: '+' }).click({ clickCount: expected.length });
  await expect(page.getByText(expected)).toHaveText(expected);

  await expect(page.getByRole('button', { name: 'Menu' })).toBeEnabled();
  await page.getByRole('button', { name: 'Menu' }).click();
  await expect(page.getByRole('list')).toContainText('Veggie-A garden of delight');
  await expect(page.getByRole('button', { name: 'Menu' })).toBeDisabled();
});
```

We add some validation of preconditions such that a pizza is already displayed at the start and that menu button goes from enabled to disabled.

We also use data driven JavaScript to control how many times we push the pizza button and then to assert that the right number of pizzas occur, and we change the locator to find an exact text value rather than some possible substring.

### Debug the test

When we run the new test we get an error saying that it couldn't find the pizzas after we added them all. The error is showing that we made way more pizzas than we imagined.

![expect pizzas error](expectPizzasError.png)

If we debug the test by placing a breakpoint on the first line and then stepping through we can see our error.

![Playwright debug](playwrightDebug.gif)

We are using the `length` operation on a string with emojis in it. Length is not going to take into account the unicode size of the emoji. So we need to convert it to an array of characters first and then get the length.

```js
await page.getByRole('button', { name: '+' }).click({ clickCount: [...expected].length });
```

Running the test again reveals another error. We were not taking into account the original üçï that existed before we inserted the new ones. To solve this we just insert one less pizza than we expect to be there in the end.

```js
await page.getByRole('button', { name: '+' }).click({ clickCount: [...expected].length - 1 });
```

### Mocking

We can demonstrate how mocking works with Playwright by replace our actual call to the `jwt-pizza-service` with a mocked HTTP response. We want to mock out the call because we don't want our test to fail whenever the menu changes. However, the danger here is that the JSON response might change and test will no longer detect the failure.

This turns out to be really easy. You just call the `route` method on the page object that is passed to the test and provide a function that can both validate the request and return a response.

```js
// Mock out the service
const menuResponse = [{ title: 'Veggie', description: 'A garden of delight' }];
await page.route('*/**/api/order/menu', async (route) => {
  expect(route.request().method()).toBe('GET');
  await route.fulfill({ json: menuResponse });
});
```

This doesn't return all the data that the actual endpoint was returning, but it is just what we need to validate that the UI is behaving properly.

### Final test

Here is the full test that we created.

```js
// @ts-check
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';

test('test', async ({ page }) => {
  const menuResponse = [{ title: 'Veggie', description: 'A garden of delight' }];

  // Mock out the service
  await page.route('*/**/api/order/menu', async (route) => {
    expect(route.request().method()).toBe('GET');
    await route.fulfill({ json: menuResponse });
  });

  await page.goto('http://localhost:5173/');
  await expect(page.getByText('Pizza')).toBeVisible();
  await expect(page.getByText('üçï')).toBeVisible();

  const expected = 'üçïüçïüçïüçïüçï';
  await page.getByRole('button', { name: '+' }).click({ clickCount: [...expected].length - 1 });
  await expect(page.getByText(expected)).toHaveText(expected);

  await expect(page.getByRole('button', { name: 'Menu' })).toBeEnabled();
  await page.getByRole('button', { name: 'Menu' }).click();
  await expect(page.getByRole('list')).toContainText('Veggie-A garden of delight');
  await expect(page.getByRole('button', { name: 'Menu' })).toBeDisabled();
});
```

## Coverage

## GitHub Action execution

## Modify the tests

I then deleted the examples and modified the simple `example.spec.js` to be `store.spec.js` and to contain the following.

```js
// @ts-check
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';

test('testAddStoreButton', async ({ page }) => {
  let serverStoreJson = [
    { name: 'nyc', date: '2028-01-01' },
    { name: 'san diego', date: '2032-10-31' },
  ];

  // Mock out the server
  await page.route('*/**/api/store', async (route) => {
    expect(route.request().method()).toBe('GET');
    await route.fulfill({ json: { store: serverStoreJson } });
  });

  await page.route('*/**/api/store/provo', async (route) => {
    expect(route.request().method()).toBe('POST');
    serverStoreJson = [...serverStoreJson, { name: 'provo', date: '2021-10-31' }];
    await route.fulfill({ json: { store: serverStoreJson } });
  });

  await page.goto('http://localhost:5173/');
  await expect(page).toHaveTitle('DevOps Demo');

  // add a new store
  await page.locator('css=input').fill('provo');
  const addStoreBtn = page.getByRole('button', { name: 'Add' });
  await addStoreBtn.click();
  const storeTable = page.getByRole('cell', { name: 'provo' });
  await expect(storeTable).toHaveText('provo');
});
```

## Adding coverage

This is proving to be more difficult than expected.

[Tutorial](https://mickydore.medium.com/adding-playwright-tests-to-your-vite-project-with-code-coverage-f6cfa65f0209)

The basic steps are to install

- playwright-test-coverage: wrap all the test calls with the calls that start and stop test coverage on each page. I believe this is just using the basic Playwright coverage API.
- vite-plugin-istanbul: use istanbul (aka nyc) as a vite plugin.
- nyc: Code coverage library used to generate and visualize the output.
- create nycrc.json to specify nyc parameters for failing the coverage test.

[NYC Docs](https://github.com/istanbuljs/nyc)

Create nycrc.json

```js
{
  "check-coverage": true,
  "branches": 80,
  "lines": 80,
  "functions": 80,
  "statements": 80
}
```

Modify vite.config.js

```js
import istanbul from 'vite-plugin-istanbul'

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [
    ...,
    istanbul({
      include: ['src/**/*'], // files to track coverage on
      exclude: ['node_modules'], // files to NOT track coverage on
      requireEnv: false
    })
  ]
})
```

Change tests to use playwright-test-coverage

```js
// import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test' <- we can remove this
import { test, expect } from 'playwright-test-coverage';
```

add a new script that runs tests with coverage using nyc

```json
// package.json
"scripts": {
  ...,
  "test:e2e-coverage": "nyc --reporter=lcov  --reporter=text-summary playwright test"
}
```

The different reporters do different things. `lcov` will create an HTML report. `text-summary` prints out a simple display.

this produces a file named:

**coverage/lcov-reports/index.html**

## GitHub Action with coverage

Finally I modified the action to run the coverage test

```yaml
jobs:
  build:
    name: Build client
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout repo
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Setup Node
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '20.x'
      - name: Build
        run: npm ci && npm run build
      - name: Install Playwright Browsers
        run: npx playwright install --with-deps chromium
      - name: Run Playwright tests
        run: npm run test:coverage
```

Now when I run the action it fails

```
Run npm run test:coverage

> pizza-client@0.0.1 test:coverage
> nyc --reporter=text-summary playwright test
