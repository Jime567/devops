# Grafana Cloud

Grafana is a company known for data visualization, allowing you to monitor and analyze metrics and logs through customizable dashboards. It supports various data sources and integrations, including popular monitoring tools like Prometheus, Graphite, and Elasticsearch.
They have their own open-source tools, which they provide in a cloud instance for which they offer a free version that we will use in this course. We will use their tools to meet the following needs:

- Visualization: Dashboards
- Logging: Loki
- Metrics: Mimir
- Tracing: Tempo
- Alerts: Alert Rules and OnCall (Alert Escalation)
- Load Testing: K6

Grafana gives an explanation of some of these:

> Each observability signal plays a unique role in providing insights into your systems. Metrics act as the high-level indicators of system health. They alert you that something is wrong or deviating from the norm. Logs then help you understand what exactly is going wrong, for example, the nature or cause of the elevated error rates youâ€™re seeing in your metrics. Traces illustrate where in the sequence of events something is going wrong. They let you pinpoint which service in the many services that any given request traverses is the source of the delay or the error.
