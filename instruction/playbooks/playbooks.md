# Playbooks

Failure recovery playbooks serve as essential guides for organizations to efficiently respond to and manage unexpected system failures or disruptions. These playbooks provide detailed, step-by-step procedures and protocols that outline the necessary actions to be taken when a failure occurs, ensuring a swift and effective response. They help mitigate the impact of outages by detailing roles and responsibilities, communication plans, and escalation paths. By having well-defined recovery processes, organizations can minimize downtime, reduce data loss, and maintain service continuity. Additionally, these playbooks are crucial for training staff, standardizing recovery efforts, and ensuring compliance with industry regulations and best practices, ultimately enhancing the overall resilience and reliability of the organization’s infrastructure.

A good playbook will include the following.

- **Playbook objective**: What systems and types of failures does the playbook cover. RTO and RPO metrics are defined.
- **Roles and responsibilities**: Who are the key teams and personal that are responsible to respond to the failure.
- **Communication plan**: How will the team communicate and where can you find the teams contact information.
- **Incident detection and notification**: Defines the pertinent observability metrics, altering thresholds, and escalation paths.
- **Diagnostic process**: Detailed instructions for diagnosing the failure, along with the tools and resources that can assist in the process.
- **Recovery procedures**: Detailed instructions for resolving the failure.This includes variations for temporal-recovery, reboot, and replacement strategies. processes for manual intervention, initiation of automation, or self-healing automation are defined. Data recovery and rollback processes are detailed.
- **Post-recovery actions**: Steps for verifying the recovery, documenting its impact, and defining prevention tasks.

## ☑ Assignment

Create a playbook for the JWT Pizza that covers what to do when the JWT Pizza Factory endpoints fail to respond or are experiencing high levels of latency.

Put your playbook in a file named `playbooks/jwtFactory.md` and commit it to your fork of the `jwt-pizza` repository. When you are done submit the URL of your playbook to the Canvas assignment. This should look something like the following:
