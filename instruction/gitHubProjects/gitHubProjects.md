# GitHub Projects and Issues

This is awesome. I have to figure out how to use this for the class
You create projects that are linked to a repo. You then create issues and you can do full project management with them. Including estimation, sizing, and scheduling. They can be assigned to people and include full markdown descriptions.

This needs to be introduced early so that we can show how to add issues, and associate it with a Git commit.

[Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue)
[Tutorial](https://medium.com/@abedmaatalla/how-to-link-github-commits-branches-to-github-issues-7afadef13971)

1. Create a project
1. Add an issue from a repo that has the power to resolve the issue
1. When you commit add a reference. You can also impact the flow in the commit.

   ```
   fix(test) data

   resolves #1
   ```

   This will close the issue.

## Different issue actions from commit

- close
- closes
- closed
- fix
- fixes
