# AutoGrader

For most of the deliverables for this course, the grading is handled by an automated grading application.

## Getting started

1.  Go to the [AutoGrader website](https://cs329.cs.byu.edu).
1.  Sign in with your byu credentials.
1.  Click on the `My Info` tab.
1.  Ensure the fields are filled correctly.
    1. Provide your hostname with a subdomain of `pizza` for the website. If you decide later to name your JWT pizza application differently, update the AutoGrader.
    1. Provide your github username.
1.  Note that it displays an API key. This will be used later for making calls to the JWT Headquarters Pizza Factory.

## Formatting your commit messages

A core part of your deliverable submissions is showing proof of your work. You do this by committing frequently and consistently through out your work on the deliverable. When grading a course deliverable, the AutoGrader will **look** for commits that follow a specific format. At the start of each commit message, put a hashtag `#` followed by `d` and the deliverable number. For example, if you were committing for deliverable 3, your commit message would look like this:

```bash
git commit -m "#d3 Your message here"
```

⚠️ **Note**: If you do not follow this format, your grade may be penalized by as much as 20%.
