# Testing variations

**Key points**

- Understand the different types of testing

While the general idea of testing is to simply verify that code is doing what it is supposed to do, it is often helpful to classify testing into different types of categories. This helps use define the tools, limits, and expectations that a specific test suite will focus on.

### Unit testing

Unit testing demonstrates the correctness of a very small piece of code such as a function or class. This differs from other testing models that focus on how code integrates into a larger system, is used by a customer, or handles load.

### Component testing

### Integration testing

### End-to-end testing

## Regression testing

Before the software industry learned to automate our testing, it was common practice to write or modify some code, manually test it, and then execute a frenzy of manual spot checking to make sure we didn't break anything that depended on the code we changed. For a quality assurance team, regression testing was the major focus of what they did. This created a very inefficient cycle of developers making changes to a specific part of the code and QA rejecting those changes because it broke different parts of the system.

Once we started writing unit, integration, and end to end tests, you could make a change and then easily run a full suite of tests that increased confidence that everything worked as it did before. You no longer need to have an independent QA team debug you code.

### User acceptance testing

### Load testing

### Compatibility testing

### Accessibility testing

### Localization testing

### Penetration testing

### Smoke testing

### Beta testing

### Black and white box testing
