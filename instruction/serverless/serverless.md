# Serverless

Serverless allows us to have scalable (elastic) compute without significant management overhead. There is no state and so we still need a persistent store service such as S3 or Aurora.

## Security

It would be good to have some sort of authorization to protect the endpoints.

## Infrastructure as code

Next we want to create a deployment process for updating the server that we can run from GitHub actions.

## Versioning our endpoints

## Testing the load

## Testing end user experience
