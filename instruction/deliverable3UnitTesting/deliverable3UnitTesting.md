# Deliverable â“·: Unit testing

![course overview](../courseOverview.png)

Now that you have the JWT Pizza Service in your hands you can start to assure its quality by writing unit tests. We will then use GitHub Actions to run your tests whenever a commit is made to your fork of the repository.

If you haven't already done so, make sure you fork the [jwt-pizza-service](../jwtPizzaService/jwtPizzaService.md) repository and clone it to your development environment.

## Configuring Jest

Before you can create any unit tests, you need to configure the project to use Jest and supertest.

```sh
npm install -D jest supertest
```

## Creating the first test

Now you can create your first test by creating the following directory structure in your fork of the jwt-pizza-service project code.

```txt
dir stuff
```
