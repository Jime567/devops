- Runtime spec
- Distribution spec (registries)

## Installation

On windows and Mac you have to install a virtual machine so that you can run Linux and thus have docker.

The easiest way to do this is to install docker desktop from the docker website.

https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/

After installing Docker Desktop there are some simple tutorials that you can run through.

You create an image and then you create a container to host the image. You can start and stop the container.

## Building an image

I ran `docker init` in a directory. This set up the Dockerfile and a compose.yaml file.

Then I went and build a simple node.js express app. I then build the image and pushed it to dockerhub using my leesjensen account.

```sh
docker image build -t leesjensen/cs329:v2 .
docker push leesjensen/cs329:v2
```

## DockerHub

Cloud repository for images. I created my account `leesjensen` and a repo `cs239`

I created a tag in my local repository and then pushed it up to docker hub

```sh
docker tag docktest-server:latest leesjensen/cs329:v1
docker push leesjensen/cs329:v1
```

You can build, set the OS version, and push to dockerhub all in one command.

```sh
docker buildx build --platform linux/arm64/v8 --push --tag leesjensen/server:v2 .
```

I can then delete the local image, pull it down again, are start it running as a container.

```sh
docker image rm leesjensen/cs329:v2
docker container run -d --name server -p 4000:3000 leesjensen/cs329:v2
```

`-d` means to run it in the background, `--name` is the name to run the container under. `-p` is the port mapping, and then the registry/repo:tag that I want to pull down and run.

## Containers

I can list the running containers with

```sh
docker container ls
```

I can stop and start the container with

```sh
docker container stop 867eff82a98e
docker container start 867eff82a98e
```

Delete the container 867eff82a98e

```sh
docker container rm
```

I can also use the name that I provided, `server`, when I created the container to run these commands.

```sh
docker container run -d --name server -p 4000:3000 leesjensen/cs329:v2
docker container stop server
```

### Running a container interactively

Run the standard `linux` container and start a shell. The last parameter is the process to run. Since we specified sh, the shell starts. We could also run `ls`.

```sh
docker container run -it --name demo alpine sh
```

To stop the container and exit the interactive shell just type `exit`, or to leave it running press `CTRL+P+Q`.

To remove a container use

```sh
docker container rm demo
```

Normally you would have to stop a container before you remove it, but you can use the force `-f` flag to both stop and remove it.

You can think of virtual machines as virtual devices that run on top of the hardware level.
You can think of containers as virtual machines that run on top of the operating system level.

## Docker CLI Reference

```sh
docker ps
docker ps --all
docker images
docker start <container id>
docker stop <container id>
docker exec <container id> ls -la # runs a command on the container
docker compose up   # build an image and started a container
docker kill <container id> # kills the container
```

## Building a container

I then ran `docker init`

```ps
docker init

Welcome to the Docker Init CLI!

This utility will walk you through creating the following files with sensible defaults for your project:
  - .dockerignore
  - Dockerfile
  - compose.yaml
  - README.Docker.md

Let's get started!

? What application platform does your project use? Node
? What version of Node do you want to use? 20.10.0
? Which package manager do you want to use? npm
X Sorry, your reply was invalid: Value is required
? What command do you want to use to start the app? npm run start
? What port does your server listen on? 3000

CREATED: .dockerignore
CREATED: Dockerfile
CREATED: compose.yaml
CREATED: README.Docker.md

âœ” Your Docker files are ready!
```

Then I went and build a simple node.js express app.

And ran `docker compose up`. I think this ran `docker build .` and then started a container with the resulting image. I was able to then open the browser and see my website.
