In order to demonstrate your mastery of load testing you will now create and execute your own load tests using K6.

## ‚òë Assignment

Follow the steps described in the [Grafana K6](../grafanaK6/grafanaK6.md) instruction to do the following.

1. Using the K6 Test Builder interface, create a test that:
   1. Logs in a user
   1. Navigates the menu to create a pizza order
   1. Buys the pizza
   1. Validates that the pizza JWT is valid
1. Execute the test and analyze the results.
1. Use the script generated by the Test Builder to create another test using the Script Editor.
1. Alter the script so that it checks to make sure the login and purchase requests succeed with the proper HTTP status code.
1. Alter the test script so that it doesn't have a hardcoded JWT in the pizza verification request, but instead reads it from the purchase response. This should be similar to how the authentication token is handled.
1. Execute the test and analyze the results.
1. Save a copy of your load test script to your fork of the `jwt-pizza` repository under the name `loadTests/loginAndOrder.js`.

Once this is all working, submit an image of your script results to the Canvas assignment. This should look something like this:

**Congratulations!** You have completed the process of using K6 for load testing. Time to go celebrate. I'm thinking pho üç≤.
