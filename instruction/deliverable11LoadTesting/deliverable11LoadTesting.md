# Deliverable 11: Perform End-to-End Load Testing on JWT Pizza

Now that you have learned to perform simple load tests with k6, it's time to load test a more typical use of your pizza application. In this deliverable, you will load test the process of a new user registering and ordering pizzas.

## Perform a service load test

In the `k6` folder, create a `jwt-pizza-order.js` file. The options can be identical to the simple test. You will change the default function to perform the following steps:

1. Make a post request to the backend login endpoint to register a new user.
1. Make two post requests to the backend order endpoint ordering pizzas.

To see how to structure your request objects, you can look at the endpoint specifications in `jwt-pizza-service`.

## Managing cookies

The order endpoint expects the authentication cookie that was sent in the register response. A simple way to get and send cookies is by using a `cookie jar` as follows:

```javascript
// Create a cookie jar to store the authentication cookie
const jar = http.cookieJar();
// Replace the backend url with the url of your pizza-service
res = http.post('https://pizza-service.cs329.click/api/auth', JSON.stringify(userObject), {
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  jar: jar,
});
```

The cookie jar will store the cookies from the response, and you can send them in the order request by adding the `jar` property to the request.

## â˜‘ Assignment

ðŸš§ Perhaps have them automate the load test as part of deployment?

In order to demonstrate your mastery of the concepts for this deliverable, complete the following.

1. Create a service load test

Once this is all working, submit JWT Pizza URL of your fork of the `jwt-pizza` repository to the Canvas assignment. This should look something like this:

```txt
https://pizza.cs329.click
```
