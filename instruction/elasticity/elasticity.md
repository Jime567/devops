# Elasticity

Making your systems scalable is important for both cost and customer satisfaction.

S3 scales
You can scale vertically by increasing the container vCPU, memory
You can scale horizontally by increasing the number of deployed containers
MySQL allows for DB scalability. Aurora would be better.
ALB Scale groups, ECS Scaling, Fargate Scaling all allows for compute scalability
Load balancer allows for scaling
Redis and memcache allow for compute scalability on stable data
CloudFront allows for global network scalability on network resources

Redundancy / fallbacks?

Availability zone scaling
Regional scaling
