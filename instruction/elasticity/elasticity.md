# Elasticity

Making your systems scalable is important for both cost and customer satisfaction.

Aurora allows for DB scalability
EC2 Scale groups, Lambda and Fargate allows for compute scalability
Redis and memcache allow for compute scalability on stable data
CloudFront allows for global network scalability on network resources
Maybe we should do this we AWS load balancers also
