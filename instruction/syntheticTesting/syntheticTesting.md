# Synthetic testing

Synthetic testing exercises the application from the users perspective from different places in the world. In one sense, this is the most authentic testing that you can do against your application because it uses the actual environment that your customers are using. If your synthetic tests fail, then it probably means that your users are experiencing problems.
