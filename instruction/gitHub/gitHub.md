# GitHub

I think we can assume they know GitHub because 260 is a prereq. We are going to go deeper in this class.

- Basic introduction to GitHub
- We use GitHub to get course materials
- Assignment to make a github account
- Discuss how we are going to use gitHub in the class. This can be done with a simple diagram
  - Course product repo
  - Your fork of the repo
  - Deploy to GitHub Pages
  - GitHub actions to deploy
  - GitHub issues/projects to track your progress
