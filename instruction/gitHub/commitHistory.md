üîë **Key points**

- Develop the habit of committing often.
- Format your commit messages so the AutoGrader can find your commits.

## Commit often

For many of the deliverables in this course, you are **required** to have a significant number of meaningful commits in order to get full credit.

Committing your code often is an important practice for you to develop. It protects you from losing your work, allows access from anywhere, makes it so you can quickly share changes, reduces conflicts with your peers, and enables you to efficiently explore different possibilities. This also enables others to review the progression of your development efforts in order to prove the originality of your work.

## Points for Strong Commit History

Points will be awarded for committing often and before the deadline. Some of your commits can be on the day the deliverable is due, but if all your commits are on the deadline, you will not receive full credit.

Some of the deliverables can be completed in a few hours, but waiting until the deadline for a project to begin work is not a habit that your employers will appreciate. Start early and commit as you go.

## Formatting your commit messages

When grading the deliverable, the autograder will **only** look for commits that follow a specific format. At the start of each commit message, put a hashtag `#` followed by `d` and the deliverable number. For example, if you were committing for deliverable 3, your commit message would look like this:

```bash
git commit -m "#d3 Your message here"
```

‚ö†Ô∏è **Note**: If you do not follow this format, you will **not** receive credit for your commit history, which represents a significant part (10-20%) of your deliverable grade.

Remember to make meaningful commit messages that describe the **what** and **why** of the changes made. Here is a [good post](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-write-better-git-commit-messages/) on how to make meaningful commit messages.
