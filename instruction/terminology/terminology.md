# Terminology

As with any branch of computer science we like to through around a lot of technical sounding terms that are wrapped up in cryptic acronyms. This is certainly true of Quality Assurance (QA) and DevOps. DevOps itself is a obfuscation of the term developer operations, which is a combination of software development skills combine with application management operations. Before we get into the details of how to do QA and DevOps we should define all of the related acronyms.
