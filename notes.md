## GitHub Pages

- [Instructions](https://pages.github.com/)
- Create a repo with the same name as the account and a `.github.io` suffix.
- Add a `index.html` file
- Go to `https://accountname.github.io`

## GitHub Actions

- [GitHub Token](https://dev.to/github/the-githubtoken-in-github-actions-how-it-works-change-permissions-customizations-3cgp)
- [Actions Tutorial](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions)
- [Secrets](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/using-secrets-in-github-actions)
- [Article similar to what i did](https://gohugo.io/hosting-and-deployment/hosting-on-github/)
- [Docs Pages from actions](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-your-github-pages-site#creating-a-custom-github-actions-workflow-to-publish-your-site)
- add build.yml
- I got a good deployment script to work with just actions owned by github. But it only deploys to the [pizzashop repo](https://softwaredeliverymanagement329.github.io/pizzashop/). I need to figure out how to get it on a URL without a path.

## GitHub Projects

- I think we can make use of this.
