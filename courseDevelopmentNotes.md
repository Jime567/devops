## PizzaShop

### Frontend sitemap

This should be enough complexity to demonstrate testing, coverage, and security.

```mermaid
graph TB;
    Home-->History
    Home-->About
    Home-->AdminDashboard
    AdminDashboard-->CreateFranchise
    AdminDashboard-->RefundFranchise
    Home-->FranchiseDashboard
    FranchiseDashboard-->CreateStore
    FranchiseDashboard-->Register/Login
    Home-->DinnerDashboard
    DinnerDashboard-->Register/Login
    DinnerDashboard-->Payment
    Home-->Order
    Order-->Payment
    Order-->Register/Login
    Home-->Register/Login
```

### System architecture

- **PizzaShopUI**: The client app. Course provides all the code. The student deploys, writes tests, adds metric instrumentation, and logging.
- **StudentDB**: Student deploys a DB backend.
- **StudentBE**: Course provides all the code. The student deploys, writes tests, adds metric instrumentation, and logging.
- **ClassJWT**: Course provided JWT demonstrates what backend is asking for pizza JWT. This also allows for chaos injection.
  - Slow down how quickly it responds
  - Send a response that the Backend driver code uses to delete the database, or delete the DB data.
  - Return a failure saying that they need to request a new V2 Client token.
- **ClassBE**: Course provided Backend until the student deploys their own.
- **ClassDB**: Course provided DB until the student deploys their own.

```mermaid
graph LR;
    subgraph class provided
    ClassBE-->ClassDB
    ClassBE-->ClassJWT
    end
    subgraph student provided
    PizzaShopUI-->ClassBE
    PizzaShopUI-->StudentBE
    StudentBE-->ClassJWT
    StudentBE-->StudentDB
    end
```

## AutoGrader

- Hook into CAS
- Has DB for storing student info
- connection to canvas to adjust grades
- Simple UI to trigger grading
- Admin triggers for chaos injection
- TA Github account that the students must let be admin on their repo
- Late day calculation

```mermaid
graph LR;
    subgraph class AutoGrader
    AutoGrader-->|get version/JWT|PizzaShopUI
    AutoGrader-->|trigger deployment|GitHubAction
    AutoGrader-->|get coverage|GitHub

    AutoGrader-->|record grade|Canvas

```

## Changes made for coursework

- Bucket for ECR images
- ECR repository with associated image uploads
- ECS cluster with associated task definitions, services, security groups, and deployments
- EC2 ALB for cluster
- Bucket for cloudformation templates
- CloudFormation deployment stack

## Grafana

- Creation of junk account

## Setting the upstream user and password

I had to set the upstream to contain a password since it was the student account. This is really valuable since I can set it on a repo instead of an account.

```sh
git remote set-url origin https://byucsstudent:xxxx@github.com/byucsstudent/jwt-pizza.git
```

You can specify the upstream for the fork to the original repository with:

```sh
git remote add upstream https://github.com/devops329/jwt-pizza.git
```

You can see what the remotes are with

```sh
git remote show origin
git config --get remote.origin.url
git config --get remote.upstream.url
```

To remove the upstream

```sh
git remote remove upstream
```

## Handling a merge conflict with the remote

```sh
git remote add upstream https://github.com/devops329/jwt-pizza-service.git
git fetch upstream
git checkout main
git merge upstream/main
```

## Triggering chaos

You trigger an injection for a learner with a call like:

```sh
curl -X PUT http://localhost:4000/api/admin/vendor/111111 -H "Content-Type:application/json" -H "authorization:Bearer xxxx" -d '{"chaos":{"type":"badjwt|fail|throttle"}}' | jq '.'
```

This will cause a `reportUrl` field to start appearing on pizza order requests. The location of the field will differ depending on the injection type. However, it always shows up and if they debug or have good logs they should be able to find it easily.

```sh
{
    "order": {
        "items": [
            {
                "menuId": 1,
                "description": "Veggie",
                "price": 0.0038
            }
        ],
        "storeId": "2",
        "franchiseId": 1,
        "id": 155
    },
    "jwt": "jwthere",
    "reportUrl": "http://pizza-factory.cs329.click/api/support/1111111/report/22222222"
}
```

The learner the calls that url and the problem goes away. In the factory I track when the chaos was injected and when it was resolved.

```json
{
  "chaos": {
    "type": "none",
    "errorDate": "2024-06-07T22:28:40.174Z",
    "fixDate": "2024-06-07T22:28:40.170Z"
  }
}
```

### Three chaos injections

1. Fail responses
1. Bad JWT
1. Throttled responses.

They have 24 hours to correct. Every hour after the first 24 hours deducts 5%.

## Vulnerabilities

- Identification and Authentication Failures
  - Weak passwords
- Broken Access Control
  - URL bypass (docs) (robots.txt)
  - delete franchise
- Security Misconfiguration
  - stack in errors,
  - jwt-pizza-service: `X-Powered-By: Express`
  - Didn't change default password (admin)
  - Containers have a public IP address
- Injection
  - Update user
  ```sh
  curl -X PUT $host/api/auth/4 -d '{"email":"f@jwt.com'\'' WHERE id=3333; select 1+1; -- "}' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -H "Authorization: bearer $token" | jq '.'
  ```

## Known security vulnerabilities

1. Inject on order description
1. Escalation on add user with a given role
1. Reveals config `server: Express`
1. If you use the same name for creating a franchise it will leak the SQL error
1. Returns code stack with error
1. Docs page has the demo data user's email and password
1. Does not use cookies
1. The default jwtSecret is not changed in their `config.js` file.
1. Deployment will log db credentials when a connection failure happens.
1. There is a default admin user with an email and password displayed in the docs
